# Bike-Sales-Project
This excel project answered questions, potential stakeholders may want to find regarding to the type of customers who use and rent their bikes.
Key demgoraphics were investigated to identify how they interacted with the comapanies products.
1. Established a worksheet for calcualtaions and formula creation. A backup was created to keep the raw data.
2. The data was cleaned using standardisation, while calculations were made to make the dashboard more seamless.
3. I utilised pivot tables, in order to analyse certain aspects of the data and create relevant visualisations.
